## General Information
- All members of the group will keep duplicate copies of all project materials within their repositories, members without current copies will be graded as such.
- If the assignment is called `P04` then each member will have a `P04` folder within their assignments folder.
- Any and all material dealing with your presentation will be placed in this folder.
  - Any source code used
  - Any input or output files used or created.
  - Presentation materials (like ppt slides) if you used them. 
- This folder will also contain a hand out, which should facilitate note taking, or help in understanding your talk.

## Presentation Overview
- Your presentation needs to last whatever time is determined, so plan on discussing your topic in a given amount of time.

# NOT COMPLETE ... MORE FIXES COMING
- Start by answering the questions that I posted for your topic, then expand my list as you find additional information that you find relevant or interesting.
- Graphics, Images, Example Code or anything visual will really help your presentation.
- Reading your slides is not good, so putting lots of bullets and text will degrade your presentation.
- Any hands on demonstrations (code examples, running programs, etc.) will be greatly appreciated. For example a discussion of semaphores without code will not go well.
- Each person should talk, but if one person wants to just control the slides I won't object. As long as the entire talk/demo is not dominated by a single person.
- There are two documents that are provided for you in this folder: [presentation_grade_rubric.md](./presentation_grade_rubric.md) and [presentation_grade_sheet.md](presentation_grade_sheet.md) to help you understand what is being graded. 
- A "grade sheet" will be handed to everyone in class so you can grade each other for each presentation.
