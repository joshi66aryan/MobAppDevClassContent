### Menu Component

I'm not going to direct how you style your app, but I want to see some effort placed into styling. You can use whatever css framework that you choose, or write all your own (good luck with that). It seems that `bootstrap` is a little friendlier but may be less powerful than something like `tailwind` or `material`. Below are a couple of examples of menu's. There are

### Registration Page

This page is accessible by anyone visiting your site / using your app. It does exactly as it says. This will register a user via a form that contains the following elements:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Username (can be email)
- Password 
- Verify Password

Later we can try and use Github, or Google , Facebook , or one of those services to register with an app, but for now lets keep it simple. 

### Login Page

- Username / Email
- Password

### Search Page

- Category Dropdown
- Candy Dropdown (based ono category selection)

### Presentation
