## Expo vs Npx.

The distinction between `expo install` and `npx expo install` hinges on how the Expo CLI is invoked, and it's essential to clarify this to avoid confusion.

### `expo install`

- **`expo install`** is the correct command when you have the Expo CLI installed globally on your machine or when you're using a project-local version of Expo CLI through npm scripts defined in your `package.json`. This command ensures you install versions of libraries that are compatible with your current Expo SDK version. It's a wrapper around `npm` or `yarn` that adds the additional step of checking for compatibility.

### `npx expo install`

- **`npx expo install`** is used to run the Expo CLI command without having the Expo CLI installed globally. `npx` is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, which allows you to run the Expo CLI (or any other CLI tool) directly without globally installing it. The `npx` command ensures you're using the latest version of Expo CLI for the operation. 

### When to Use Which?

1. **If you have Expo CLI installed globally**, you can directly use `expo install` without needing `npx`.

2. **If you don't have Expo CLI installed globally** or prefer not to install it globally, use `npx expo install`. This approach ensures you're always using the latest version of the Expo CLI without the need for global installation.

### In Practice

Given the Expo team's recommendation to avoid global installations to ensure compatibility and ease of updates, using `npx expo install ...` for your Expo commands is generally the safer and more recommended approach. This ensures that you're always using the most current version of Expo CLI tailored to your project's needs without having to manage global package versions.

So, to correct and clarify based on current best practices:
- Use **`npx expo install ...`** to install libraries in your Expo project, especially if you're not keeping the Expo CLI updated globally.

This approach is part of why `npx` is so valuable in modern JavaScript and Node.js development workflowsâ€”it allows for the execution of CLI commands and packages without requiring global installations, reducing version conflicts and ensuring compatibility.
