## Expo On Mac

To install Expo on a Mac, you'll need to follow a series of steps which involve setting up your development environment with the necessary tools and then installing Expo CLI itself. Here's a summarized guide based on the information from the sources:

1. **Install Homebrew**: Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that simplifies the installation of software. Open the Terminal app on your Mac and run the following command to install Homebrew:
   ```
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
   Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

2. **Install Node.js and npm**: Expo CLI requires Node.js. You can download Node.js from [the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). npm, the Node.js package manager, is included with Node.js.

3. **Install Watchman**: Watchman is a tool by Facebook for watching changes in the filesystem. It's useful for projects with a large number of files. Install it using Homebrew with the command:
   ```
   brew install watchman
   ```

4. **Install Xcode**: For iOS development with Expo, Xcode is necessary. You can install Xcode from the Mac App Store. After installing, make sure to open Xcode to agree to the license agreement and install any additional required components.

5. **Install Expo CLI**: With Node.js and npm installed, you can install Expo CLI globally using npm with the following command:
   ```
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

6. **Verify Installation**: To ensure that Expo CLI is installed correctly, you can run the following command in the terminal:
   ```
   expo --version
   ```
   This should display the version number of your Expo CLI installation.

After completing these steps, your Mac should be ready for Expo development. You can start creating new Expo projects and building apps for iOS and Android【11†source】【12†source】【13†source】.

## Expo On Windows

To install Expo on a Windows machine that uses WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and VSCode, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install WSL**: First, ensure that WSL is installed on your Windows machine. You can install it by following the official instructions from Microsoft. Choose your preferred Linux distribution from the Microsoft Store (e.g., Ubuntu).

2. **Install Node.js in WSL**: Expo CLI requires Node.js. It's recommended to install the LTS version of Node.js in your WSL environment. You can do this using a version manager like `nvm` to easily switch between Node.js versions if needed.

3. **Install Visual Studio Code**: If you haven't already, install Visual Studio Code on Windows. Make sure to add it to your PATH during installation to easily open folders in WSL using the `code` command.

4. **Install the WSL Extension for VSCode**: This extension allows you to use WSL as your full-time development environment directly from VSCode. It lets you develop in a Linux-based environment, use Linux-specific toolchains, and utilities, and run and debug your Linux-based applications from Windows.

5. **Open a WSL Terminal**: Open a new terminal in WSL by typing `wsl` in your command prompt or PowerShell, or by using the WSL terminal directly from the start menu.

6. **Install Expo CLI**: In the WSL terminal, install Expo CLI globally using npm with the command `npm install -g expo-cli`.

7. **Verify Installation**: To make sure Expo CLI is installed correctly, you can type `expo --version` in your WSL terminal.

8. **Start Developing**: You can now create a new Expo project by running `expo init YourProjectName` and start the development server with `expo start`.

Remember, when using WSL and VSCode together, any operations you perform in VSCode with the WSL extension will be executed in the WSL environment, ensuring compatibility and a seamless development experience.

For more detailed instructions and troubleshooting, you might want to consult the official [Expo installation guide](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) and the [Visual Studio Code documentation for developing in WSL](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl).
