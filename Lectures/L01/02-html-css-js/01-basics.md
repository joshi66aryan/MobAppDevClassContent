## Introduction to Web Development Basics

In this section: "Introduction to Web Development Basics", we'll focus on the foundational elements of web development: HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. 

### HTML Basics

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It defines the structure of web content.

#### Sample HTML Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first web page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and HTML version.
- `<html>`: The root element of an HTML page.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document, like its title.
- `<title>`: Specifies the title of the document (shown in browser's title bar or tab).
- `<body>`: Contains the content of the document, such as text, images, links, etc.
- `<h1>`: Represents a header (largest header).
- `<p>`: Represents a paragraph.

### CSS Basics

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pagesâ€”for example, changing the color, font, and spacing of your content, splitting it into multiple columns, or adding animations and other decorative features.

#### Sample CSS Code

```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    margin: 20px;
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: #f8f8f8;
}

h1 {
    color: navy;
}

p {
    color: #555;
}
```

- `body`, `h1`, `p` are selectors, which specify the HTML elements to style.
- Inside the curly braces `{ }`, there are properties and values. For example, `font-family: Arial, sans-serif;` sets the font style.

### JavaScript Basics

JavaScript is a scripting language used to create and control dynamic website content, like interactive forms, animations, etc.

#### Sample JavaScript Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="header">Hello, World!</h1>
    <button onclick="changeText()">Click Me!</button>

    <script>
        function changeText() {
            document.getElementById("header").innerHTML = "Welcome to JavaScript!";
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

- The `<script>` tag contains JavaScript code.
- `function changeText() {...}` defines a function to change the text of the header.
- `document.getElementById("header").innerHTML = "Welcome to JavaScript!";` changes the content of the element with `id="header"`.

### Bringing It All Together

When teaching these concepts, it's important to show how they interact together. For example, you could start by explaining and demonstrating a basic HTML structure, then introduce CSS to style this HTML, and finally use JavaScript to add interactivity.

The provided examples are quite fundamental, but they offer a solid foundation for students to understand the essence of web development. You can then build upon these basics with more complex topics as the course progresses.
